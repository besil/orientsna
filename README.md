# orientsna

OrientSNA is a collection of social network algorithms for networks written in Java, based on OrientDB.
The project uses Maven for dependency management.

I hope to deliver more algorithms in a near future.
Any help will be appreciated.

The implemented algorithms are, for now:
- [x] Connected components
- [x] Triangle Count
- [x] Label Propagation
- [ ] PageRank



## Quickstart
```java
```
